# Reconbot
**Reconnaissance and Enumeration bot**

Reconbot allows you to speed up the process of Reconnaissance and Enumeration by automaticly running different nmap scans, enumeration scripts and brute-force scripts. All logged in their seperate files while displaying some details to be able to start poking quickly.

## Installation
You only need 1 python package for this script to work, to install use the following command:

`sudo pip3 install termcolor`

Then you can just run reconbot:

`sudo ./reconbot 10.10.10.10`


## NOTE
This script uses different scripts/wordlists that would have to be installed, most of them are already installed on kali linux which is also the only OS this has been tested on. Since this was meant to be a script for just personal use I do not intend to create support for every OS or advanced installation scripts. You can however always send me a message on discord or github if you have a problem / bug or idea!
